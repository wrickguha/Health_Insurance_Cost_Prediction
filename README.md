# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📖 Overview  


This project is a Health Insurance Cost Prediction system that utilizes Multiple Linear Regression to estimate insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and more.

## 🚀Technologies Used


### Machine Learning & Data Processing

pandas – For data manipulation and analysis

numpy – For numerical computations

scikit-learn – For building and training the regression model

matplotlib & seaborn – For data visualization and insights

### Web Development


Flask – Backend framework for model deployment

HTML, CSS & Bootstrap – For the frontend design

## 📌Project Features

Data Preprocessing & Visualization: Cleaning and analyzing the dataset

Machine Learning Model: Training a Multiple Linear Regression model

Web Application: Users can input their details and get predicted insurance costs

Deployment on AWS: My first experience deploying a project on AWS

## Project Deployment

This project is successfully hosted on AWS, where the Flask backend interacts with the machine learning model to provide real-time predictions.
